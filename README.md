# wm-bus-json-serializer

An embedded JSON serialization library for smart meter gateway data.

This project implements a lightweight, deterministic, and transport-agnostic
JSON serializer intended for embedded firmware environments such as STM32 and ESP32.
It converts structured meter and gateway data into a predefined JSON format
suitable for gateway-to-backend communication.

---
## Platform & Programming Language

**Programming Language:** C 

**Target Platform:** Embedded systems (STM32 / ESP32 compatible)

### Justification

The library is implemented in C to ensure deterministic memory usage,
minimal runtime overhead, and maximum portability across embedded platforms.
No dynamic memory allocation is used, and all buffers are provided by the caller,
making the implementation suitable for resource-constrained microcontrollers.

## Public API

The library exposes a single public function for JSON serialization:

```c
wm_json_status_t wm_serialize_to_json(
    const wm_gateway_data_t *input,
    char *output,
    size_t output_size,
    size_t *written_size
);
```

## Example JSON Output
The following JSON output is generated by running the example application
(`examples/example_main.c`). It demonstrates correct serialization according
to the required schema.

```json
[
  {
    "gatewayId": "gateway_1234",
    "date": "1970-01-01",
    "deviceType": "stromleser",
    "interval_minutes": 15,
    "total_readings": 1,
    "values": {
      "device_count": 1,
      "readings": [
        {
          "media": "water",
          "meter": "waterstarm",
          "deviceId": "stromleser_50898527",
          "unit": "m3",
          "data": [
            {
              "timestamp": "1970-01-01 00:00",
              "meter_datetime": "1970-01-01 00:00",
              "total_m3": 107.752,
              "status": "OK"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```
